Making new presentations in Toaster is extremely simple.
In this presentation, we'll show you:

# Creating a Piece of Toast #
Making a new piece of Toast is as simple as uploading a text file.
As long as you follow a few simple rules, our website will take care of everything for you.
Any text file should be fine!

# The Title Delimiter #
Every new slide in your Toast presentation starts off with a Title
A Title is delimited on both sides with the pound or hashtag symbol. 
Under a title is any text that will go on that slide.

# Some More Delimiters #
Creating a list in Toaster is easy, also. Just start
    1. Numbering
    2. And a list  
    3. will automagically generate
There are even more syntax commands you can throw in:
    -_Underline_ text is one underscore on each side
    -*Bold* text is *one star* on each side
    -~Italic~ text is one tilde on each side

# Inserting URLs #
If you want to insert a link, it's as simple as
    {http://www.google.com}[This is the word]

# Formatting Your Piece of Toast #
That's it! All your formatting is now done.
There are a few more symbols you can throw in, but all that info
will be on our website. From here, Toaster will take your text
and pop out a new piece of Toast! 
We hope you enjoy!
