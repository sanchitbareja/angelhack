<h1> Creating a Piece of Toast </h1>
Making a new piece of Toast is as simple as uploading a text file.
As long as you follow a few simple rules, our website will take care of everything for you.
Any text file should be fine!
<h1> The Title Delimiter </h1>
Every new slide in your Toast presentation starts off with a Title
A Title is delimited on both sides with the pound or hashtag symbol.
Under a title is any text that will go on that slide.
<h1> Some More Delimiters </h1>
Creating a list in Toaster is easy, also. Just start
<ol>
<li> Numbering</li>
<li> And a list</li>
<li> will automagically generate</li>
</ol>
There are even more syntax commands you can throw in:
<ul>
<li></u>Underline<u> text is one underscore on each side</li>
<li><b>Bold</<b> text is </<b>one star</<b> on each side</li>
<li><i>Italic</i> text is one tilde on each side</li>
</ul>
<h1> Inserting URLs </h1>
If you want to insert a link, it's as simple as
<a href="http://www.google.com">This is the word</a>
<h1> Formatting Your Piece of Toast </h1>
That's it! All your formatting is now done.
There are a few more symbols you can throw in, but all that info
will be on our website. From here, Toaster will take your text
and pop out a new piece of Toast!
We hope you enjoy!
